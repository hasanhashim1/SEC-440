# Lab - Windows Admin Center

## Pre-Lab Configuration:
You have some new systems - please do the following:

### AD01
*   Make sure system is on your LAN Network
*   Before configuring Networking, use sconfig to turn updates to Manual
*   Set Timezone to be EST
*   Set the Hostname to be AD01
*   IP is 10.0.5.5/24
*   Install AD/DS, providing a domain of yourname.local
*   DHCP is a good idea (On your LAN only), you can either integrate that within AD or on one of your linux lan systems
*   Create a named Domain Admin and a named Domain User
### FS01
*   Make sure system is on your LAN Network
*   Before configuring Networking, use sconfig to turn updates to Manual
*   Set Timezone to be EST
*   Set the Hostname to be FS01
*   IP Address is 10.0.5.7
*   Joined to yourname.local
### WKS1
*   Make sure system is on your LAN Network
*   Joined to your domain
*   DHCP is a nice touch but not required\
